# Fair-Tech-Collective
The code in this repositry are the scripts I wrote to do data analysis on Fair Tech's project on air pollution data in specific locations in the bay area: 

This Read-me will list all the scripts and a short summary of what they do. But first I would like to put a short summary on how to pull data on Esdr. There are two ways 
1. Go to https://esdr.cmucreatelab.org/browse/ and select the data you want to view and right click and download as csv or json format
2. Use curl from your terminal to pull the data. The script titlesd "" helps to pull data monthly. You can go to https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/esdr/blob/master/HOW_TO.md to learn more about ESDR and how to use it.
